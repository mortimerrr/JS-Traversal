#### An exercise on adding X3D objects to HTML with JavaScript.  
This was done at the Full-Stack Ruby Web Development course at We Got Coders. (wegotcoders.com)

We were practicing the following JavaScript methods:

1. document.createElement()
2. document.appendChild()
3. document.removeChild()
4. document.setAttribute()
5. document.getElementById()
6. document.getElementsByTagName()

#### How to use

Open index.html in your favourite browser.  
Click on click me button (bottom-right) a few times to add random 3D shapes.  
Drag them with a mouse to rotate them in 3D.
